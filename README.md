# Bosch Battery CAN Bus
This repository explores the interaction with Bosch e-bike batteries via the CAN bus and gathers relevant online resources for research and experimentation.

## Overview

This project is focused on using the CAN bus to communicate with Bosch e-bike batteries. The goal is to understand the protocol, send commands, and receive data from the battery.
